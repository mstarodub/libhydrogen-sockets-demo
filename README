A little demo on how to use https://github.com/jedisct1/libhydrogen to transmit
encrypted structs over the wire (using sockets, in this case), which I wrote for
illustration purposes when working at https://aris-space.ch/.

keygen.c contains a test.

./keygen new
to generate a keypair.

./server/server
./client/client
to run.
